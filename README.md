# USACO-Training 

These are the solutions in C++ to some of the problems from previous USACO (United States Computing Olympiad) contests (http://usaco.org/index.php?page=contests), as well as a few problems from the training page provided (http://usaco.org/index.php?page=training). The solutions pass all of the test cases in at least most of the problems solved (unless otherwise specified).

Most problems also have a comment with the commit specifying any important details about the solution, and in some rare cases there are comments in my code. Runtime is also sometimes included if it is important or interesting.
